# Tests
Test are currently being written. So far the tests are not ideal and the code strutcture is poor.
They will be improved when I get time to work on them more.

For the time being, some manual testing is recommended in addition to using these tests.

### Running Tests
You should ensure that all tests are passing before creating a pull request. If you create a pull request with new features, creating new tests for your additions is highly appreciated. You can run all tests with the command: 
```terminal
poetry run pytest
```
